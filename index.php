                      I’m very grateful to the Amazon Publishing Hub team;
                      Antonio, Walter, and the other team members who worked
                      on my book are excellent. This team at Amazon Publish
                      does outstanding work. They’ve been accommodating in
                      getting my first book published on time. The editing
                      team is fantastic at catching some important typos etc.,
                      and the marketing team, too, is outstanding. I had
                      excellent communication and was updated weekly at every
                      stage of my first book project. I’m currently working
                      with the same team on my second book and possibly the
                      third soon. Keep up the excellent work you are doing.
                      Love you all.

                      My experience has been wonderful! I started working with
                      the team in the new year and by the end of February, I
                      not only had written the book but it was edited and
                      published. Ted and the rest of the team have been very
                      nice! They work super hard and are very good at what
                      they do. Most importantly they have been easy and stress
                      free to work with. Not once did I feel as if I was
                      pressured to turn in my manuscript. Not once did they
                      make me feel bad about my writing or any choices that I
                      mad. They let me have as much control over my work that
                      I wanted. I have enjoyed working this them very much and
                      I hope to continue this relationship. 10/10 would
                      recommend this service to friends.

                      AMAZON Publishing Hub is a great way to publish your
                      book. My experience with Ted and his team was terrific!
                      Communication played a big key in the process. Their
                      professionalism and knowledge helped make my dream a
                      reality. It was a short process to get my children’s
                      book published. The Press Release was so wonderfully
                      awesome as well! I’m very touched beyond words. My
                      thanks and appreciation to Ted and his team! My heart is
                      still smiling!
