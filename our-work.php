                        I’m very grateful to the Amazon Publishing Hub team;
                        Antonio, Walter, and the other team members who worked
                        on my book are excellent. This team at Amazon Publish
                        does outstanding work. They’ve been accommodating in
                        getting my first book published on time. The editing
                        team is fantastic at catching some important typos etc.,
                        and the marketing team, too, is outstanding. I had
                        excellent communication and was updated weekly at every
                        stage of my first book project. I’m currently working
                        with the same team on my second book and possibly the
                        third soon. Keep up the excellent work you are doing.
                        Love you all.

                        My experience has been wonderful! I started working with
                        the team in the new year and by the end of February, I
                        not only had written the book but it was edited and
                        published. Ted and the rest of the team have been very
                        nice! They work super hard and are very good at what
                        they do. Most importantly they have been easy and stress
                        free to work with. Not once did I feel as if I was
                        pressured to turn in my manuscript. Not once did they
                        make me feel bad about my writing or any choices that I
                        mad. They let me have as much control over my work that
                        I wanted. I have enjoyed working this them very much and
                        I hope to continue this relationship. 10/10 would
                        recommend this service to friends.

                        AMAZON Publishing Hub is a great way to publish your
                        book. My experience with Ted and his team was terrific!
                        Communication played a big key in the process. Their
                        professionalism and knowledge helped make my dream a
                        reality. It was a short process to get my children’s
                        book published. The Press Release was so wonderfully
                        awesome as well! I’m very touched beyond words. My
                        thanks and appreciation to Ted and his team! My heart is
                        still smiling!
